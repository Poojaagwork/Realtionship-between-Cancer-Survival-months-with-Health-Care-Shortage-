Here I have tried to understand if there is a Relationship-between-Cancer-Survival-months-with-Health-Care-Shortage. 

Demographic and Economic determinants of cancer survival in Medically Underserved Area

Data Resource - SEER Database 21.0
Healthcare Shortage area data - https://data.hrsa.gov/data/download

Match HPSA (Healthcare provider shortage area) zipcode with Zipcode in the intestinal Cancer data
Separate the Intestinal cancer data into two comparison group
One with HSPA matched data (Zipcode with less physician)
Other without HSPA
Compare “Number of intervals” (AF Column)
I want to see if Age, Gender, percentage of  NHB Race ( Non-Hispanic Black) in the HSPA
